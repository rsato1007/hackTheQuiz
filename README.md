## General Information
This project is being developed as a simple study app for programmers to keep up on their programming concepts. I built this app because I wanted a place where I can quiz myself and study programming concepts that a little hard to implement in pure coding practice. While many tools exist out there that can achieve the same result, I wanted to practice building an app using Django and React plus eventually gamify the app for better user engagement. Furthermore, this project will serve as a part of my portfolio.

## Technologies
- Django
- Django REST framework
- React
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL

## Development Process
The development process for this app will be a little different from previous projects as I am utilizing a scrum based method designed with single programmer in mind.

Additional resources being used in the development process:

- [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ev2h3lGt/quiz-app-board)

## Status
At the time of this writing, I am working on planning sprint one and wanted to get the basic files up on Github.

## Future Updates
As mentioned in my general information section, this will be designed with gamification in mind. This section will be updated as features are planned.
